### Folder Structure
This application uses a multi-module architecture though the packages are not in seperate packages this can easily be done. for purposes of simplicity I under them under `src` 


Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project inside of `src`

```
.
├── app
...
├── components
...
├── core
...
└── features
...
```


1. The **app*** module holds app-related things for example the app entry component, main routes, etc
Ideally, high-level components that are needed by an app

```
├── app
│   ├── App.tsx
│   └── rootNavigation.tsx
```

2. The **core*** module contains common things that an app needs, and various features can depend on this module for example things found on the core module include:
   - assets - a central place for managing assets instead of directly using them in the app, which makes it easy to change assets
   - config - Set up your config; things like `APIURL`, sentry URL, etc
   - constants - constants used in your application
   - theme - the app uses a custom theme to provide theming
   - styles - includes extensions on various colors, text styles, durations, Corners
   - And many more

For this app here were my core modules; constants to hold my immutable variables, sizes for dynamic and responsive designs, textTopography for my custom text topography, and lastly theme that exposed a hook for getting theme colors based on the theme of the device 
```
├── core
│   ├── constants.ts
│   ├── sizes.ts
│   ├── textTopography.ts
│   └── theme.ts
```

3. The **Feature*** module houses all the features and in this app they include

Ideally, a feature has the following;
- screens - screens in that feature
- store - have your state management solution here
- components - reusable components in that feature

```
└── features
    ├── Landing
    │   ├── components
    │   └── screens
    │       ├── landing.screen.tsx
    ├── Home
    │   ├── components
    │   └── screens
    │       └── home.screen.tsx
    ├── Search
    │   ├── components
    │   └── screens
    │       └── search.screen.tsx
    ├── Categories
    │   ├── components
    │   └── screens
    │       └── categories.screen.tsx
    ├── Detail
    │   ├── components
    │   └── screens
    │       └── detail.screen.tsx
    ├── profile
    │   ├── components
    │   └── screens
    │       ├── profile.screen.tsx
    │       └── settings.screen.tsx
```
